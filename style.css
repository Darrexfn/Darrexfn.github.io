        <p> Darrex aka Darren Ray D'Alessio is 15 years old and from
            Switzerland. He was a member of the professional and famous
            Teamxhing. He was signed in the team as a Beta Player which
            was the second best Tier. Teamxhing was grounded in
            Europe, Germany. The founder is a Youtuber with almost
            15000 Youtube subscribers and he is still active as a
            content creator and professional gamer. After round about
            1 Year he closed the Team sadly with 15000 followers
            because of unhappiness with the players and members of the Team.
            After this he grounded a new Team called Underdog which closed after 2 months
            with 500 Followers and grounded a new one called Elaze.gg which is still
            existing with 2500 Followers. Now Darrex is a Player for the little
            swiss german-english Team PJC (Project Chaos) which is based in Switzerland.
